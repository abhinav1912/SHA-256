# SHA-256

Simple SHA256 algorithm implementation using Python.
Followed this [guide] for a step by step explanation. 

## Features

- Generate SHA256 hash for any string
- Object oriented arch for reusability
- wip: unit tests to ensure correctness

## Installation

Can be executed on any Python version, but v3+ is recommended.

- Clone the repository
- In `main.py`, modify the `root_string`. Set it to the value for which you need to compute the hash
- Execute `main.py`
